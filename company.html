<h2>About REE: A Solid Foundation</h2>
<h3>Meet Matthew Raynor</h3>
<h4>My name is Matthew Raynor, and the waste water industry has always fascinated me. With 20 years of experience in the field, I founded Raynor Environmental Enterprises on the principle of finding waste water solutions using common sense and fiscal responsibility. Managing a property or business in today's environmental climate requires expertise in navigating all types of reporting for both state and federal agencies. I am licensed in North Carolina in:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Waste Water Treatment Operation</li>
<li>Well Water Operation</li>
<li>Sub-Surface Operation</li>
<li>Spray Irrigation Operation</li>
<li>Water Distribution</li>
<li>Sewer Collection Systems</li>
</ul>
<h4>I have worked in the public/municipal sector, private sector, and commercial sector in a variety of U.S. states. Before founding Raynor Environmental Enterprises, I had 15 years of experience with property environmental assessment working with a real estate investment company. REE has gained trusted affiliates in engineering and property management. I now reside in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains in Banner Elk, North Carolina.</h4>
